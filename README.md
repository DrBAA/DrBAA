## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently in a non-tech related role but hope to transition into tech in the near future. Also hoping to collaborate with others on tech projects.

### **Tech courses undertaken**

  Intro to Coding MOOC

  Intro to Python MOOC

  Solving problems with Python MOOC

  Intro to C# MOOC

  Intro to Web Development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript MOOC

  Intro to JavaScript MOOC

  Intro to Data and SQL MOOC

  Intro to Git and Git Hub MOOC

  Intro to Cloud and Deployment MOOC

  Intro to Python and Apps Kickstarter, August 2023

  Intro to Data and SQL Kickstarter, January 2024

  Entry to tech bootcamp with Coding Black Females which focused on backend software development using Java computer programming language, November 2024
  
  Intro to JavaScript Kickstarter, January 2025

### **Tech Projects Completed/Underway**
  Created a MYSQL relational database from scratch with 11 tables all normarlized to 3NF and then created several queries/subqueries and other functionalies to query the database or perform various other tasks.
  
  Created a mini data pipeline (ETL) using Python and Pandas dataframe to extract data from a CSV file, clean the data and load it into MYSQL database.
  
  Currently working on a web app which uses a Java Springboot API to fetch data from a MYSQL database, JavaScript Fetch API to communicate with the Java API and display the data on the web app using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
  I plan to host the web app online using cloud platforms such as Render for back end code, Netlify for front end logic and Aiven for databases. I also plan to set up CI/CD pipelines for the front/back end logic and MYSQL database so as to
  automatically update the code online whenever I make any changes in my local machine. This will ensure that the users of the web app have the most up to date changes as they are released.
  
  Created a trading algorithm (using Java) as part of the above bootcamp.
  
  Created a web app for a mini library management system with 2 other students as part of the Intro to JavaScript Course finished in January 2025

### **My future goals and aspirations**

In future, I hope to work in data engineering or software engineering. I am also very interested in learning more about machine learning, and AI powered electronic trading algorithms then designing such algorithms to help traders scan the market for trading setups more easily/quickly as compared to searching manually.
