## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently in a non-tech related role but hope to transition into tech in the near future. Also hoping to collaborate with others on tech projects.

### **Tech courses undertaken**

  Intro to Coding MOOC

  Intro to Python MOOC

  Solving problems with Python MOOC

  Intro to C# MOOC

  Intro to Web Development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript MOOC

  Intro to JavaScript MOOC

  Intro to Data and SQL MOOC

  Intro to Git and Git Hub MOOC

  Intro to Cloud and Deployment MOOC

  Intro to Python and Apps Kickstarter, August 2023

  Intro to Data and SQL Kickstarter, November 2023 - January 2024

  Entry to tech bootcamp which focused on backend software development using Java computer programming language, May 2024 - November 2024.
  
  Intro to JavaScript Kickstarter, December 2024 - January 2025

### **Tech Projects Completed/Underway**
  1). As part of the intro to data and SQL kickstarter course finished in January 2024, I created a MYSQL relational database from scratch with 11 tables all normarlized to 3NF. I also created several queries/subqueries and other functionalies to query the database or perform various operations.
  
  2). Created a mini data pipeline (ETL) using Python and Pandas dataframe to extract data from a CSV file, clean the data and load it into MYSQL database.
  
  3). As part of the Entry to Tech bootcamp finished in Nov 2024, I created a trading algorithm (using Java). This included the trading algorithm logic, J-Unit tests and Backtesting to ensure the algorithm worked as expected.
  
  4). As part of the Intro to JavaScript Course finished in January 2025, I created a web app for a mini library management system with 2 other students. This used JavaScript, CSS and HTML to display data on the web app. Also used browser's Local Storage for data persistence.

  5). Currently working on a web app for a food pantry to fulfil a personal goal. The web app uses the following tech stack:
  Java Springboot API to fetch data from a MYSQL database,
  JavaScript Fetch API to communicate with the Java API to fetch data and display the data on the web app using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
  I plan to host the web app online using cloud platforms such as Render for back end code, Netlify for front end logic and Aiven for databases.
  I also plan to set up CI/CD pipelines for the front/back end logic and MYSQL database which will automatically update the code online whenever I make changes in my local machine.
  This will ensure that the web app users have the most up to date changes as they are released.
  I have already started this process by hosting MySQL database on Aiven cloud platform. Currently trying to set up a CI/CD pipeline for this database using GitHub Actions but still struggling to update the cloud hosted database when changes are made downstream. Still working on this.

### **My future goals and aspirations**

In future, I hope to work in data engineering, software engineering, platform engineering but I am also open to other opportunities where my skills can be put to use.
I am also very interested in learning more about machine learning and AI powered electronic trading algorithms, designing such algorithms to help traders scan the market for trading setups more easily/quickly as compared to searching manually.
